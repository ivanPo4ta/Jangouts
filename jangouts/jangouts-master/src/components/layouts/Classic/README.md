# Layouts

## Classic

This mimics, to a big extend, the default initial layout used by Jangouts since
its initial versions. Such layout was designed with one particular use case in
mind - the periodic meetings of a software development team in which everyone
uses a traditional computer (laptop or workstation).

In such scenario some considerations are relevant:

 * A landscape and relatively big display is assumed.
 * Since many meetings are turn-based, the list of participants must be
   displayed in the same order for everyone, to ease coordination.
 * The person who is speaking (should always be only one at a time in such
   structured meetings) is displayed in greater detail. Again an uniform
   criteria is used to ensure all the participants see the same.
 * It should be visible in every moment which participants are muted. Unmuting
   oneself is commonly used as a way to indicate the intention to intervene.
 * The chat is pretty important and must be visible alongside the participants.
